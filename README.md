## Welcome to "Hullo World"

It's a simple self-hosted notebook web app modeled on [Tiddlywiki classic version](http://classic.tiddlywiki.com/).

There is an index of links to cards at the bottom of the page.  You can create a new card by clicking on the `New` button at the top of the page, or you can write a title in WikiTitle format and it will automatically be turned into a link that will create that card when you click on it.

You can save the current content by clicking on the `Save...` button at the top of the page.  Your browser will prompt you for saving.

On a card clicking the `Edit` button will switch it to an edit mode that lets you change the title or edit the content.  The content is [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and the title should conform to WikiTitle.  The `Edit` button changes to `Done` and the `Close` button (which closes the card) is disabled so you can't accidentally close the card during editing.  (Yes, it might be preferable to auto-save on close, but whatever.  This was easy and it works well enough for now.)
